# Contributing


Before starting, [read our organization's projects](https://github.com/orgs/python-20/projects) to get an idea on what currently needs work

DO NOT COMMIT DIRECTLY TO BRANCH Master, instead,

* Fork our project
* Clone the fork onto your computer
* Edit the code
* Create a pull request 


Merge the to master ONLY after 2 person has checked that the code works.


But most importantly, have fun!
