# Contributing

Before starting, [read our organization's projects](https://github.com/orgs/python-20/projects) to get an idea on what currently needs work

DO NOT COMMIT DIRECTLY TO BRANCH MAIN, instead,

* Fork our project
* Clone the fork onto your computer
* Add and Edit the code
* Create a pull request onto a branch


Merge the side branch to main ONLY after testing and everyone has agreed to the changes, although it is best to leave it to cherylli or someone more experienced



But most importantly, have fun!
